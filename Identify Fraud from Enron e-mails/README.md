# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to identify the main characters that participated in the Enron fraud scandal, or as referred to in the project, identify persons of interest (poi). The dataset we have contains financial information of employees of Enron including salary, bonus and stocks. There is also an e-mail dataset containing e-mails around the time of the scandal with information about senders and recipients as well as the content of the e-mails. The dataset is useful to identify persons of interest because we can see who received big bonuses or sold stocks around the time of the scandal, as well as identify suspicious e-mail conversations or shared e-mails among persons of interest.

The dataset has information about 146 Enron employees. Of this, 18 are identified as persons of interest. There were two outliers: ‘Total’, which was a sum of all items in the column and ‘the travel agency in the park’, which was not an employee. There were other outliers but those were relevant to the analysis and were therefore not removed, for instance, the salary of the CEO, etc.
